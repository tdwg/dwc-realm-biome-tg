# Realm, Biome and Environmental Material Task Group
This is the working repository of Realm, Biome and Environmental Material Task Group ([charter](https://www.tdwg.org/community/dwc/realm-and-biome/)). The Task Group is established under the [Darwin Core Maintenance Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/dwc/) which maintains the [Darwin Core](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/) standard. 

The main goal of the task group is to evaluate the proposal of two terms, [biome](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues/38) and [environmentalMaterial](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues/40), and propose a new term, realm, to the Darwin Core standard, including the possibility of implementing controlled vocabularies for all terms.
